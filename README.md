## ** Goal **
Build a next-gen *AI-Powered Crisis Intelligence System* that becomes the thinking brain of a smart city during a <u>multi-disaster scenario</u>.

<br/>

## **Functionalities:**
1. Predict **cascading** disasters (e.g., flood → power outage → hospital overload)
2. Detect **fake news** or **conflicting information** in real time
3. **Visualize** risk zones and live incident maps
4. Recommend action **plans** (e.g., "Evacuate Zone C, reroute ambulances")
5. Explain decisions clearly (so city leaders can trust it)

<br/>

## **Dataset Explanation:**
- `city_map.geojson` | Huge amount of geolocations around SF Bay Area
- `disaster_events.csv` | Features of disasters collection, with severity measurement
- `economic_activity.csv` | Business transactions collection
- `energy_consumption.csv` | Energy consumption of buildings at specific time
- `events_calendar.csv` | Events time and location around the Area
- `local_business_reviews.csv` | User ratings and reviews of local businesses
- `sensor_readings.csv` | Disaster sensor data of above geolocations
- `social_media_stream.csv` | Streaming record of disasters
- `transportation.csv` | Public transportation information and status
- `weather_historical.csv` | Historical data of the weather readings

<br/>

## **Deliverables:**
- [ ] Slide Deck (*up to 9 slides*)
- [ ] One-Page Summary (*Title, teamname, what does the system do, why matters*)
- [ ] Demo (*Optional*)
