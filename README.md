## **Ultimate Goal:**
### Build a next-gen *AI-Powered Crisis Intelligence System* that becomes the thinking brain of a smart city during a <u>multi-disaster scenario</u>.

<br/>

## **Functionalities:**
1. Predict **cascading** disasters (e.g., flood → power outage → hospital overload)
2. Detect **fake news** or **conflicting information** in real time
3. **Visualize** risk zones and live incident maps
4. Recommend action **plans** (e.g., "Evacuate Zone C, reroute ambulances")
5. Explain decisions clearly (so city leaders can trust it)
